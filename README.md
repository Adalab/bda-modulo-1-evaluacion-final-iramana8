# OnlineStore - Final Assessment (Module 1)
## Description

This Assessment consists of the creation of an 'OnlineStore' class.

The class simulates the basic functionality of an online store inventory system and should include the following methods:

- add_product: Add a product to the inventory.
- view_inventory: Review all products in the inventory with their details.
- search_product: Search for a product by name and display its details if it exists.
- update_inventory: Update the quantity of a product in the inventory.
- delete_product: Delete a product from the inventory if it exists.
- calculate_inventory_value: Calculate and return the total value of all products in inventory.

The goal of this assessment is to demonstrate understanding of:

- Conditionals (if, elif, else).
- Loops (for and while). Understand how to iterate through a list or a dictionary.
- Functions (function creation with parameters and default parameters).
- Regular Expressions (Regex).
- Classes.
- Differences between Python data types (string, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries).
